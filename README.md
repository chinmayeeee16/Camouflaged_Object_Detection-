# Camouflaged_Object_Detection-
A CNN-based encoder–decoder model for Camouflaged Object Detection that handles low-contrast and texture-similar scenes. The network jointly predicts object masks and boundaries using boundary-aware learning. Performance is evaluated using Dice and IoU. A Streamlit web interface enables visualization.
